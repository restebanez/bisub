<i>Previously on AMC's
"The Walking Dead"...</i>

2
00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:06,558
And on this day,
we begin to reshape this world.

3
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:13,665
Y'all can live
if you surrender right now.

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,377
No matter what comes next,
we've won.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,679
We've already won!

6
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,914
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

8
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,281
Let's hurry it up, fishies.

9
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,016
We got our pants down out here.

10
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,285
It's only like a dozen.

11
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:18,923
Yeah, I mean...
Huck.

12
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,693
Relieve Todd
at the maintenance station.

13
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,194
- Hey, Mara...
- Shut up.

14
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,063
Give me your gun.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,433
How's that feel?

16
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,969
It, uh, feels...
Shut up.

17
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,137
Go inside. Get the coolers.
Start packing up.

18
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,875
Hey, genius.

19
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,845
Sorry.

20
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,580
Go.

21
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,992
Little Roy.

22
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,366
Little Roy, it's Mara.
You copy?

23
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,840
J-Top, it's Mara.
You copy?

24
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,313
Todd?

25
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,784
Yeah?

26
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,123
Lock the stairwell, every floor.

27
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,393
Why?

28
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:22,144

29
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:35,563
Looks like
they made themselves a moat.

30
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:42,130
I guess we shouldn't be
surprised, considering.

31
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,784
We can do this.
We did before.

32
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:48,955
Yeah.
That's what I was considering.

33
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,090
I wasn't here before.

34
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,505
Just need a clear shot.
Right, Dianne?

35
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:57,941
Just a few seconds.

36
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:01,145
So we just need
to time it right.

37
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,582
They see us, they fire a gun,
we're not getting in.

38
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:11,021
Don't let them fire a gun,
Dianne.

39
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:17,928
Morgan, do you need us
to cover you or something?

40
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:20,230
I do not.

41
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:23,500
Hey, we're here to help.
It shouldn't just be you.

42
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:27,137
I don't die.

43
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,756
Your majesty!

44
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,758
Where is he?

45
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:49,793
Find the King!

46
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,428
The damned are upon us!

47
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,798
Protect the King!

48
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,499
Protect yourselves!

49
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,455
Anyone see where he went?

50
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:56,059
He saw us.

51
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,363
If he tells them we're here,
it's over before it started.

52
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,399
It is not, and he won't,

53
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:05,836
for we together
will find him, end him,

54
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,338
and fulfill the promise
of what we have begun.

55
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,708
Trust the King.

56
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,845
Outpost is due north,
through the woods.

57
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,914
As that's surely his course,
so shall it be ours.

58
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,517
If our comrades had already
arrived, they'd have been here.

59
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:21,952
Return to the staging area.

60
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,687
Gather the others
when they land.

61
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:26,356
And if they haven't yet,
release Shiva from her cage.

62
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,759
Due north.
We'll leave a trail for you.

63
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,361
Ensure no enemies remain
in these environs,

64
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:32,763
and be not 10 minutes behind.

65
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:33,764
Go.

66
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,099
- Onward!
- Whoo!

67
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,469
To our foe,
then to his compound,

68
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,471
then to certain victory.

69
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,100
Spread out!
Watch for breaches!

70
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:13,003
We keep 'em locked in, they got
bigger problems than us.

71
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,775
I can hear the shooting.

72
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,077
Stay where you are.

73
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,079
Do not say another word.

74
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,080
Ugh!

75
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,115
Ohh!

76
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,503
You signal
if they're already inside.

77
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,637
We'll be there.

78
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:50,841
Come on.
Let's find them guns.

79
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,458
Dino, we need an opening.
Find one or make one.

80
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,826
What the hell?

81
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:44,694
Hey!

82
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:05,849
Ugh!

83
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:07,884
Ohh!

84
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,514
Ain't on this floor.

85
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,316
Only option is up.

86
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,318
High ground.
Good cover.

87
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,220
Yeah, I'd put them
up there, too.

88
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,454
Stairs.

89
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,979
They're too chickenshit
to move in on us.

90
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,415
We push them back!
Go!

91
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,569
We got some coming up
on my right.

92
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,238
Stay on them!
Don't let them through!

93
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,707
We pin them in,
it takes care of itself!

94
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:44,841
That's the plan!

95
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,309
Tobin, move in!

96
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:20,877
I can take them!
Cover me!

97
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,312
No!
Wait for Tobin!

98
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,214
There's no time!

99
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,418
Go!
I'll help cover you!

100
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:52,481
Last floor.

101
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,716
The guns have gotta be up here.

102
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,918
He said they'd be here.

103
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,220
Everything else he passed you
is checking out.

104
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:00,589
That guy's a piece of shit.

105
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,191
Those guns get to the Sanctuary,

106
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:06,061
they could cut through those
walkers and free up an exit.

107
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:08,230
We'll go faster if we split up.

108
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,732
I find the M2s,
you find 'em, we use them,

109
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,601
hit the courtyard
right then and there.

110
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:14,770
End this quick.

111
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,587
Aah! Please!
Please don't shoot me!

112
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:32,855
Shit.
Please don't shoot me.

113
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,890
- Please don't...
- Huh.

114
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:37,860
Oh, look, you pissed your pants.

115
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,394
I-I'm not one of them.

116
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,064
Uh, m-my name's Dean.

117
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,532
Why are you still talking?

118
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,568
Tara, wait.

119
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:50,239
- Just wait.
- For what?

120
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,807
He has his hands up, Tara.

121
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:54,209
We have a job to do.

122
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,081
You want to go check that out?

123
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,461
We're missing some people
from the other team.

124
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,129
Morgan?

125
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,966
Come out.

126
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,843
Just stay in there.

127
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,244
We're on top of each other here.

128
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,479
We'll signal you
when it's clear.

129
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,481
Just be ready.

130
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,955
I got it, Jesus.
Step aside.

131
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,156
Tara.

132
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:42,491
There's a firefight outside.

133
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:43,926
We don't even know
if Morgan's alive.

134
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,427
Please, lady.
I'm not one of them.

135
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,329
You're here. You had a gun.
You are one of them.

136
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,097
I'm not. I'm not.
You got to believe me.

137
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,198
Then what are you doing here?

138
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:52,467
I'm just a worker.

139
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,936
They brought me
from the Sanctuary

140
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,171
to cook, clean, whatever.

141
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,040
They did not give me a choice.

142
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:00,809
They made me leave
my wife and kids.

143
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:08,183
Your people do this
to the Sanctuary, too?

144
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,351
The families okay?

145
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,620
We don't want to hurt
the workers.

146
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,288
We're not going to.
You believe him?

147
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,823
It's not about him.

148
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:15,958
I'm not gonna shoot someone
with their hands up,

149
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,693
and I'm not letting you.

150
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:21,363
These medical supplies --
they're the Hilltop's, right?

151
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,201
Maggie's prenatals.

152
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,670
They took them
because they could,

153
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:29,805
because they don't give a shit.

154
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,139
So why should we?

155
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,307
I know they killed
your girlfriend...

156
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,042
Jesus --
...that you loved her.

157
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,211
This isn't you.
It is now.

158
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:37,746
We're not here for revenge.

159
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:38,847
It can't be about that.

160
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,215
It can.

161
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:42,718
Aah!

162
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,626
I wouldn't.

163
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,162
You know what's funny?

164
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,599
Normally I'd peg you
as the softie, not pretty boy.

165
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:01,670
You know how hard it is
to piss yourself on purpose?

166
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,640
I-It's like your dick knows
you're wearing pants.

167
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,280
Aw, hell, look that.

168
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,883
Well, that shit is ruined.

169
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:19,287
Well, looks like that dumb bitch
Maggie and her kid

170
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:22,024
are just gonna die, anyway,

171
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,358
Just like you two.

172
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,426
I'm gonna kill you.

173
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,294
Oh, honey, no, you're not.

174
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,363
Then someone else will.
There's too many of us.

175
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,098
See, that's where we differ.

176
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:31,633
If I take the two of you
with me,

177
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,136
then I've got one hell
of an insurance policy.

178
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,871
So why don't you put
that thing down

179
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,408
unless you're gonna shoot
through this beautiful man here.

180
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,910
I'm not gonna ask you again.

181
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:42,911
I think she's gonna shoot you.

182
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,079
I am.

183
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,714
Yeah.
She is.

184
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,882
Shut up!

185
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,983
Tara --
I can do it.

186
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:49,051
Tara, he has a gun to my head.

187
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,152
Not for long.

188
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:51,253
Wait. Wait.
Wait a second.

189
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:52,654
Go to hell.
Okay.

190
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,991
So you really
wanna risk it, huh?

191
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,226
Me for him?

192
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,162
Well, I can tell you right now
that I am not worth it.

193
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:02,464
We can work this out.

194
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:05,467
I-I may talk a big game
like I'm a tough guy,

195
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:06,968
but I'm not.

196
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:09,171
I really just want to...

197
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,288
You're not gonna do it.

198
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:29,291
Not you.

199
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:32,027
It's not about revenge.
It's about getting it done.

200
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Ugh!

201
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:42,270
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,972
He tried to kill us.

203
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,341
I told you --
it's not about him.

204
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,510
So he gets to live?

205
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:52,714
What about Abraham?
Glenn? Denise?

206
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,549
This is different.

207
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,952
You're not Rick.
You're not Maggie.

208
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,286
No.

209
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,355
But she'll hear
what I have to say.

210
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,058
Evac Sat 1! Evac Sat 1!

211
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,895
Jesus! Tara!

212
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,802
They're falling back!

213
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,573
Go! Go! Go!

214
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:21,309
There another way out of here?

215
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,979
Yeah.
Follow my lead.

216
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,870
- Tobin!
- I'm okay!

217
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:59,406
Just keep going!
I'm okay!

218
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,591
They didn't
have to move in on us.

219
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:19,993
Shit.

220
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,599
Aah!

221
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:45,018
Up ahead.

222
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,319
I see it.

223
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:48,121
This is me.

224
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,702
What befell this creature?

225
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:09,943
I mean before you.

226
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,846
We don't have time
to figure that out.

227
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,547
Compound's not far off.

228
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,216
If he made it,

229
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:18,818
if they know we're coming,
they're gonna be ready.

230
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:23,490
Two possibilities,
just one fact.

231
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:27,460
And what's that?

232
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:29,829
We shall be ready regardless.

233
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:36,403
What's about to happen,
it's not just a few walkers.

234
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:38,004
You know that, right?

235
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,940
Yes.
And yet I smile.

236
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,110
Why?

237
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,084
Do I feel the supreme
confidence?

238
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,720
Or is my lot, my job,

239
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:57,991
to simply protect
such certainty?

240
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,727
No and yes.

241
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:02,829
Yes and no.

242
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,031
And then finally yes to both.

243
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:11,337
Fake it till you make it, baby.

244
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:14,774
That's what I've done
and what I do.

245
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,610
I am King because
I-I have provided a light

246
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,946
to lead my people forward
through the darkness,

247
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:23,116
and they have made
my fictions realities.

248
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:25,919
So, with all this and everything
that's happened --

249
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:29,122
All of us may not make it.

250
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,423
We may not even win.

251
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:33,259
And yet I smile.

252
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:36,896
There will be no fantasies
of failure this day.

253
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:40,567
Hey, guys.
Is this blood from the wasted?

254
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,743
No.

255
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,413
One of us hit him
when we fired on him.

256
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,215
Means he's moving slow.

257
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,916
Hells yeah.

258
00:24:56,952 --> 00:24:58,118
We're back in business.

259
00:24:58,153 --> 00:24:59,552
Well done, Daniel.

260
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,321
Well done to us all.

261
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:04,457
We move forward...

262
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:07,293
as we move
the very world forward.

263
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,976
The M2s.
Where are they?

264
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:14,247
No...guns!

265
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,815
Grace--

266
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:18,951
They're in there?

267
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:22,855
No! No!

268
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:24,257
Ohh!

269
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:46,079
Aaaah!

270
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:05,998
<i>You sure we can do it?
We can beat 'em?</i>

271
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:18,044
<i>What this group has done,
what we've learned,</i>

272
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,248
<i>what we've become, all of us --
yes, I'm sure.</i>

273
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:29,822
Ugh!

274
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:47,607
Circle the door, wide,
at least 20 feet.

275
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,075
Guns up, but hold your fire.

276
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,076
What?

277
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:51,344
They're gonna give up.

278
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:52,712
We only fire if they fire first.

279
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,614
They fire first, one of us dies.

280
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:58,384
Then let's hope, for my sake,
that they don't.

281
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,787
You can try to stop me.

282
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:04,123
Come on! Go! Move!

283
00:30:07,562 --> 00:30:09,295
Drop your weapon!

284
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:14,066
Drop your weapon and surrender.

285
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:27,880
Living sounds good to me.

286
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:31,784
We're surrounded.

287
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,422
Don't be as dumb
as they think we are.

288
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,825
Put your guns down.

289
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:44,897
It's okay.

290
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,332
We can do it the hard way.

291
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,167
Because even if Maggie
listens to you,

292
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,570
Rick will listen to me.

293
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:25,838
Ugh!

294
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:49,629
<i>We have to come for them
before they come for us.</i>

295
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,797
<i>We can't leave them alive.</i>

296
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,904
<i>Where there's life,
there's possibility.</i>

297
00:31:57,939 --> 00:32:00,506
<i>Of them hitting us.</i>

298
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:05,678
Shit.
I know you.

299
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,346
You get transferred, too?

300
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,416
Morgan!

301
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,021
Lower your gun.

302
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,726
We came here to kill them.

303
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:28,434
We're<i> supposed</i> to.

304
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:31,537
They surrendered.

305
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,674
It's not what we do.

306
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:49,088
Then what do we do, huh?

307
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,174
Hmm.

308
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:41,407
Gracie.

309
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,542
Gracie.

310
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,544
No.

311
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,248
No.

312
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,266
That way.

313
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:51,710
There!

314
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:08,494
Save your munitions, Carol.

315
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:12,998
Our friends have arrived.

316
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:35,821
Ugh!

317
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:36,856
Aah!

318
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,040
Ahh.

319
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:57,009
Francine!

320
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,666
You okay? You okay?

321
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:58,937
I'm fine, but our people --
they need...

322
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:03,675
Oh, God.
No.

323
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:05,110
No, no, no, no, no, no.

324
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:07,079
No, no.
Eric, Eric.

325
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,381
Eric.

326
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,283
Let's go.

327
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,838
And there it is --
our certain victory.

328
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:31,781
This -- I am not glad
for his death.

329
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,910
For anyone's.

330
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,209
I know.

331
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,218
Nelson, we're on the move,
taking active measures.

332
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:45,786
Just hole up, keep it elevated,

333
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:47,988
and if you see us,
stay out of the line of fire.

334
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:53,026
Jig's up.
Gonna have to break chocks.

335
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,595
No.

336
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,264
This journey will not end
in retreat.

337
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,466
But they know we're coming.

338
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,771
Indeed they do.

339
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,681
Damn it.

340
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,585
Keep your hands down.

341
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,087
Turn around slow.

342
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:11,772
Hi, Rick.

343
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:20,314
Your name...

344
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,916
is Morales.

345
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,688
You were in Atlanta.

346
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:32,559
That was a long time ago.

347
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,165
It's over, Rick.

348
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,866
I called the Saviors back.

349
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:44,204
And they're coming.

350
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:27,185
